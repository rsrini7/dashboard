start weldmock with db.json for CURD operations
    it starts by default port 8080

start http-proxy-set-header
    it starts by default port 8000
    and it proxy to port 8080 with custom response headers
    (AVOID cors problems)

anyone wants to use CRUD with CORS enabled :
    point to http://localhost:8000
